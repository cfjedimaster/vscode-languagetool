### LanguageTool

This is a wrapper for the [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) API. It provides basic grammar and spellchecking for your files. The main focus is on Markdown files and therefore I do some work stripping out front matter and then processing the resultant rendered Markdown versus the source (if that makes sense). Obviously this is rough - PR's are welcome!
